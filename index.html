            <h2>Extra info</h2>
            <p>Hobbies: As people and the norms of society change, one thing remains. Hobbies. As a curious individual myself; I have a few hobbies I would like to share with you, the reader.
             During school i was an active reader; I would want to get my hands on any books that crossed my eyes. Some of my favorite series actually came from highschool, I fell in love with manga and different genres such as romance, horror, and mystery.
             Some of my favorite series are Bleach written by Tite Kubo, Toriko (Mitsutoshi Shimabukuro), Fire Force (Atsushi Ohkubo), and many more. With a rough guess, I believe that i`ve read over 1500 books in highschool alone.
             Another hobby of mine is model building, specifically Gunpla`s. Gunpla or gundam is a japanese anime in which the furture generations of Earth are at war with their rebelling space colonies. If you were to search up online 'Gundam Models' you would most likely find many of varying sizes.
             the sizings go from the smallest (that being Super Deformed), to the biggest (that being Perfect grade). As you were to go up in size, the model would become more challenging and require more time, patience, skill, and effort to build. I myself am still a little anxious to try one.
             Lastly, since i don`t want to strain your eyes from all this reading, my last hobby is drawing. Ever since freshman year, I have been an avid drawer, though i`m not the best, I still enjoy it from time to time. I mainly re`create pieces from series I read like One Piece and Bleach
